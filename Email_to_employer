Subject: Website Pages Are Live – Just Like a V8 on a Cold Morning

Hello John,

Just a quick note from the dev team, just to let you know that the main page, contact us page, and about us page for the Wheels on
Fire website have been created.

Main Page: Designed to make a strong first impression and guide visitors straight to the good stuff — your collection.

About Us Page: Tells your story with just the right amount of charm, honesty, and a sprinkle of that dry humour you're known for.

Contact Us Page: Simple, clean, and efficient. created boxes to store the info of people that reach out.

Here is the website link:-https://github.com/SECRXETT/WebDev_Project__UnpaidDevelopment

Let me know if you’d like to take a look under the hood or suggest any tweaks. Next up: we can start working on the inventory listings or any other pages you’ve got in mind.

Best regards,
Unpaid Development Studios
